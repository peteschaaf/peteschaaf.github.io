            <p class="about-me-content">
                Hi I'm Pete! I am a 27 year old software developer out of Columbus, Ohio. I am a big time problem solver. I love doing puzzles, figuring things out, and just understanding how the world around me works. I have been passionate about tech since I was really
                young, and the opportunity to get into the industry quickly through a bootcamp was something I HAD to jump on. I like to think outside the box and find new solutions to problems that may have already been solved. I am very very passionate
                about learning, it's one of my favorite things to do. Someday I want to get into working with AI and machine learning, it's just so cool! Other things about me: I love love LOVE the outdoors (rock climbing is my favorite activity), I love
                video games, hockey, and my dog Norman.

            </p>
